## Chapter 1 - Welcome to react

- I learnt now that a package json file describes a project and all it's dependencies. To include one in your project, you can use the command --- `npm init y`. 
    To install a package -- `npm install [package-name]`.
    To remove a package -- `npm remove [package-name]`.
